# LinkUp - Connections Made Easy

## Introduction
LinkUp is a project aimed at helping people track and maintain their professional and personal connections effectively. In today's world, where networking plays a pivotal role, it's easy to lose track of who to reach out to and when. LinkUp solves this issue by providing a user-friendly interface to manage your connections, and reminding you to reach out at appropriate times.
